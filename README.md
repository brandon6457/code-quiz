Code Quiz

Description:
This was a fun game that we designed to test knowledge of html, CSS, and JavaScript. We set a timer to see who can answer the questions the fastest and have bragging rights for highest score. We tested our javascript knowledge and abilities along with some html and CSS to create this project. We had to create the entire html, CSS, and javascript files ourselves.
